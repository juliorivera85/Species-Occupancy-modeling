# Species-Occupancy-modeling

This code allows you to plot your occupancy and detenction variables from a species ocupancy model in R. I have designed this to incorporate your standard errors along with the actual model plot. As an added bonus, I show how to code Greek letters and italics so your titles and legends are more professional looking.
